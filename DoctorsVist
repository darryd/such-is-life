Doctor’s Visit 
Doctor - Hello Chris, how are you feeling today?
Chris - Well, to be honest, I’m feeling a little nervous about those test results
Doctor - Ah, right let me look at your file
Chris - Wow, I just hope everything is okay, you know…I’ve been worrying about it..I know it’s probably nothing, but still
Doctor - Well, I’m afraid….
Chris - What is it?
Doctor - Well, the lab reports show that you have an advanced and rare form of leukemia.
Chris - Oh my God. Oh my God
Doctor - Yes, I’m afraid this is very bad news
Chris - Oh my God
Doctor - I’m afraid there’s no cure really. 
Chris - What do you mean… there’s no cure?
Doctor - I mean, there’s no cure.
Chris - Oh God.
Doctor - You need to prepare. Tell your loved ones. Make sure you have all your affairs in order.
Chris - How long do I have?
Doctor - Not long I’m afraid. Maybe two weeks.
Chris - Only two weeks?
[Pause]

Doctor - Oh come on.
Chris - I should sue you. That’s terrible. You’re a terrible person. That’s horrible.
[Chris pulls out a gun]
Doctor - Don't kill me.
Chris - Give me one reason.
Doctor - It was just a harmless joke. Don't you think you're overreacting?
