MATCHMAKER (M, M, F)

TREVOR
 Hello, good to see you. How was getting here?

SCOTT
 Traffic was crazy. Some lunatic honked at me when I was trying to make a left turn. What did he want me to do? Drive into oncoming traffic?

TREVOR
  Some drivers are idiots. Would you like to come in?

SCOTT
  Actually, that would be fantastic. 

TREVOR

I think you and my sister will get along beautifully. Hey Anne. I want you to meet Scott. Where is she? So, what’s new with you Scott?

SCOTT
   Not a lot actually. 

TREVOR
 Can I get you a drink? Can you hold a second. I just got to take care of something upstairs. Make yourself at home. Have a banana or something.

SCOTT
  Actually, I’m good.

ANNE
  Oh hey Scott. I didn’t know you were here. I love that shirt.

SCOTT
  Thanks. It matches my eyes. Don’t you think.

ANNE 
  Yes. Listen, I can’t wait to introduce you to Trevor. Believe me, I have a great talent for matchmaking. I paired up Greg with Alex. They’re inseparable now.


SCOTT
 Well, actually. I’ve met him.

ANNE
  Oh cool. What do you think?

SCOTT 
   He’s very cute.

TREVOR
   Hey look at you two. Already getting acquainted. Do I not have an eye for these things. I matched Alex with Jessica. The two have been inseparable, I say.

ANNE
  What?

SCOTT
   Oh those two will probably get married 

ANNE
  Listen Scott, my brother plays the violin. Trevor, play something.

TREVOR
  Oh not now. I’m just a beginner, really. It would be an unforgivable assault on the ears.

ANNE
  Oh come on. You sound great.

SCOTT
  Yes, I’d love to hear you play.

TREVOR
  No really. I’m pretty bad.

ANNE
  Oh, he’s just being modest

TREVOR
  Well, sure I could play for you sometime. Maybe after I’ve practiced a bit, but Scott, you know what? Anne plays the piano much better than I play violin. Play something, Anne.

ANNE
  No, I don’t think Scott is here to listen to me play the piano Are you, Scott?

SCOTT - Oh, no really. That would be great.
