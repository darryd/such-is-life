M, M, F

[door bell]

JESSICA  - Hi, come on in.

MARK - I brought some Chocolate Spiced Whisky.

JESSICA - Sounds good. I don't think I've ever tried that one before.

MARK - You wouldn't believe the day I had at work. Office politics. People are so underhanded. Always suspicious.

JESSICA - Well, honey. You've come to the right place to unwind. 

MARK - Oh, I'm sure I did.

[door bell]

JESSICA - Who could that be?

MARK - You're not expecting anyone are you?

JESSICA - No, of course not. Hello who is it.

SEAN - It's Sean

[open's door]

JESSICA - Hello, who are you?

SEAN - I'm Sean. Can I come in.

JESSICA - Ah, okay.

SEAN - Um, should I take my shoes off?

MARK - Wait a minute. Who are you?

SEAN - I'm Sean. Is this the music event?

MARK - No

JESSICA - No

SEAN - Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I got an invite to an event on Facebook, and then on Google Maps, I got this address.

JESSICA - You have the wrong address

SEAN - Oh, sorry about that. I'll be on my way.

[Sean leaves]

JESSICA - That was weird

SEAN - Yeah that was.

JESSICA - Yeah.

SEAN - So you have never seen him before?

JESSICA - Yeah, he's just some random guy.

SEAN - Oh, really?

JESSICA - Yeah, he got the wrong address.

SEAN - Oh, really?

JESSICA - Yeah. Wait, what are you saying?

SEAN - Don't insult my intelligence.

JESSICA - Are you saying what I think you're saying?

SEAN - I don't know. What do you think I'm saying. Oh, don't play dumb. He was here to see you, wasn't he?

JESSICA - That's ridiculous. No, didn't you hear him? He got the wrong address. Haven't you ever gotten the wrong address?
It happens you know.

SEAN - No, I mean, not like this. I have never shown up at someone's house by mistake. Oh sorry. I 
got a Facebook invite. 

JESSICA - Look, I don't know him. And if you don't believe me, you don't know me. How dare you.

SEAN - You know what. I'm out of here.

[Sean leaves]
